## Description
- Poké Pound is an application for the Pokémon trainers to connect with other trainers to adopt Pokémon and rehome their Pokémon.

## Installation
- To install this application, start by cloning the repo to your local device. Run ```npm init```. Run npm install. Create the database in MySQL using the schema.sql file located in the files. Run ```node seeds/seed.js``` to populate tables within the database. Run ```node server.js``` to start the server up. 
- The live Heroku app can be viewed: [here](https://desolate-inlet-00665.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
- To use this application you will need to login to the deployed site on Heroku, creating a username and password. Your Pokémon will be saved and manageable once logged in. The 'Adopt' section of the app will show all Pokémon that are available to be adopted. 'Place Pokémon up for Adoption' will allow the user to create a listing with the Pokémon's information for other trainers to adopt. The 'Dashboard' will have a listing of all of your Pokémon as well as the Pokémon that you currently have up for adoption. From the 'Dashboard', trainers can send their Pokémon back to the Adoption page if they wish and they can also 'release' them to the wild.
